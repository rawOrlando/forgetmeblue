[{"content":"Let\u0026rsquo;s first talk about this newer genre, which is Litrpg. To be a good Litrpg, you are combining two things. The engagement of a story with the dopamine of progress. This progress is usually in the form of numbers, like levels in a video game. This might sound juvenile, but I admit it is a guilty pleasure. They have hooked me like cookie clickers. My brain wants to make the numbers go up. Hearing this disruption, you might think this is a video game rpg but without the videos. Well, it is, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t in a video game; your choices are limited by the confines of the game, except in cut scenes, the protagonist can\u0026rsquo;t pull out a novel’s exciting solution to a problem. This allows the outcome and actions to remain in question. Litrpgs have two other main advantages. In many video games, especially RPGs, where your character levels up when you fail, you can try again. This causes limited stakes in the outcome of any action, which limits tension. The second is less grinding. In rpg games, often players will go do something unexciting or interesting to get stronger. If this ever happens in a Litrpg, which, in my opinion, it should be avoided, they can gloss over it without spending the audience\u0026rsquo;s time.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s talk Shadeslinger.\nThe main character Ned is weak. We start by seeing him before he enters the video game world. He has no friends. From the main character\u0026rsquo;s opinion, everyone around him only want him for his money. He inherited a ungodly amount of wealth. He uses this money to buy all the extremely expensive early access slots in the ripple system video game. To only use one and stop others from getting them. He is selfish to extremes here. When interacting with others in the game, he does not give them a chance to be friends and relegates them to a monetary contract. He frames this as protecting himself, but it is clear he causes the poor relationship problems himself. But do not worry because he is immersing himself in a whole new world that is living and breathing, where he can make friends with NPCs and the two AI he hangs out with. In this new world, he amasses power and money, creating the same problem in relationship dynamics while also not treating the npcs or ai like real people. He has flashes where he does, and he is better about it than the owner of the game, but he is quite shitty about it himself. He does nto see them as people and does not mind letting them suffer. So I don’t think his relationship issues are because he has been dealt a bad hand but instead is on himself.\nNext, let’s talk about the ripple system. One of the unique ideas behind the game is that when you affect the game world, it causes a ripple. And you, as a character, are rewarded. The first time Ned does this it is without knowing, as he saves the nicer of the two elf races dooming the other to near extinction. This created a problem. His motivations were now corrupted. It was a cool mechanic to reward a hero of a story, as they immerse themselves in the game world as the reader does the story. But Ned know thinks about ripples as a risk-reward equation in his head when making decisions in the future, which takes away the heroism in saving a town, when Ned wants the reward. This might have been fixable if ned did not think these thoughts to the audience.\nIt was a fun litrpg, but these two glaring issues were hard for me to ignore, so I will not be reading the sequel.\n","permalink":"https://raworlando.github.io/forgetmeblue/post/review-of-shadeslinger/","summary":"Let\u0026rsquo;s first talk about this newer genre, which is Litrpg.

It started with my old friend Jason Pier.\n\u0026ldquo;E! You\u0026rsquo;re coming to the bridge Friday night, right?\u0026rdquo; He sidled over to the middle of the classroom, where only me and Lance Shoo sat by the window. Jason had stopped hanging out with me three years ago when his muscles developed more than mine, and he became a regular on the baseball team. Jason had grown up while I was still a lanky kid, or at least he tried to look it with gelled-back hair and sneakers so pristine they have never even heard the word.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s going on at the bridge on Friday?\n\u0026ldquo;What?! Haven\u0026rsquo;t you come before? Well, then you got to come this time. It\u0026rsquo;s the essence of high school.\u0026rdquo; Jason talked with grand, expansive gestures as though he might lose our attention. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re diving off the bridge. It\u0026rsquo;s so much fun.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Jason\u0026hellip; that sounds dangerous.\u0026rdquo; Lance shot a hurt glance at me for not jumping at the opportunity \u0026ldquo;No, well, maybe a little\u0026rdquo; Jason was unperturbed by the suggestion and giggled as though the danger made it better. \u0026ldquo;But that\u0026rsquo;s where the slivers come in. You do some amazing stuff as you fall. No one ever gets hurt.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but that won\u0026rsquo;t work. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a sliver.\u0026rdquo; It seemed like more and more people were getting them. We didn\u0026rsquo;t need to attach something to our brains.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t?, Well, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to jump then, E. Come on, we haven\u0026rsquo;t hung out in ages.\u0026rdquo;\nJason\u0026rsquo;s eyebrows did an encouraging dance until Lance blurted, \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll come, he\u0026rsquo;ll come. I mean.\u0026rdquo; Lance\u0026rsquo;s words toppled over each other, trying to fix his mistake. Jason took in the other boy for the first time, reviewing the name at the top of his assignment. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, yeah, Lance is comin. The more, the merrier. You gotta come now. I will send you a thought with the details. wait. no sliver. Come to the old bridge after 9 on Friday night! That\u0026rsquo;s more adventurous anyways. None of these omw, crap. Just show up; nothing to it.\u0026rdquo; Jason was not letting any hurdle stand in between him and his goal. With a grand smile, now that it was all sorted, he walked off without getting an affirmation.\n\u0026ldquo;Edgar! We got to go.\u0026rdquo; I could see why Lance wanted to hang out with the cool kids. We had been missing something since Teddy moved away last month. But Jason was not actually our friend, not for three years.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, Lance; we might not really fit in.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Come onnn! We could look so cool jumping off the bridge! And be popular!\u0026rdquo; We were kind of losers at school, and Lance jumped at the chance to move up in the world’s hierarchy.\n\u0026ldquo;Lance, we don\u0026rsquo;t have slivers. We could get hurt jumping.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get some then. This is our chance to look awesome in front of everyone!'\n\u0026ldquo;Not everyone will be there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Everyone important.\u0026rdquo;\nLance was relentless; no matter the reason, he found a way around until I caved.\n• • •\nWhen I got home, I started my preparations: I cloroxed the kitchen surfaces, I vacuumed the living room, I didn\u0026rsquo;t bother or upset Tio, and I even started a fresh load in the washing machine. When Dad came home from his nursing shift, he predictably went to the kitchen where I was chopping vegetables.\nWhen the three of us were all sitting down around the pan of chop suey. Dad looked at me, spent from his shift at the hospital.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, E, what\u0026rsquo;s with this behavior?\u0026rdquo;\nThis plan always works best when he does not realize anything is different, just that he is happier. I needed to go into damage control. \u0026ldquo;What!, No , I\u0026rsquo;m not acting any different.\u0026rdquo; I stared into his intent eyes, so he knew I was not lying.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you want? We don\u0026rsquo;t have any spare money to buy something if that\u0026rsquo;s what you\u0026rsquo;re thinking.\u0026rdquo; Dad said between modest bites of the pasta as though I forgot that.\n\u0026ldquo;I mean, there is something I wanted, but not to buy. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t cost any money.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Buy something with no cost? E that does not exist. Everything has a price.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, Dad, this doesn\u0026rsquo;t. I wanted to get a sliver. The things the aliens are selling. They are free; I just need your consent.\u0026rdquo; I slid papers awaiting his signature keeping it clear of the dangerous food.\nTio chimed in, \u0026ldquo;Timmy in gym class has one. And he is really good at basketball.\u0026rdquo; [Ruin the form a bit?\nSmiling at Tio, I kept up the reasonable patter; I needed it to seem like a normal everyday event. \u0026ldquo;Jason has one, too. Most of the kids in my class have one.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I heard about these on the news. And you\u0026rsquo;re okay with that what\u0026rsquo;s it crawling up your nose?\u0026rdquo; Dad had a slight shiver just talking about it.\n\u0026ldquo;Sliver, Dad. And sure, why not.\u0026rdquo; I kept my face calm as thou that idea did not creep me out.\nPutting down his spoon, signaling the end of the conversation. \u0026ldquo;You want this?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Alright then. I\u0026rsquo;m gonna look into it; then we can talk about it some.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;But, I need one by Friday. Also, can I go out Friday night?\u0026rdquo;\nThe skeptical look came back over his face. \u0026ldquo;I am working late tomorrow. I need time to look into this before I let one crawl up your nose. But” the last word hung in the air, “ you can go out, be home by ten.\u0026rdquo;\n• • •\nFriday came as a cloudy night. The stars failed to show, leaving splotches of darkness surrounding the halos of light cast by the street lamps. I beat Lance to our usual meeting spot in front of the small playground. It was where all our friends in elementary school would meet. Lance and I were all that remained. I heard his screeching brakes before he left the darkness. The first thing I noticed was his fanatical grin; the second was that he had forgotten his helmet. His mouth opened wider as he spewed word vomit in between desperate wheezes. \u0026ldquo;Edgar, you\u0026rsquo;re already here!, I have great news., I got \u0026rsquo;em!.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What really you got one!\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yes! Gonna be so cool! You know I am. Off the bridge\u0026rdquo; He nearly careened into my bike before stopping and catching his breath. \u0026ldquo;What did it feel like, you know, crawling up there?\u0026rdquo; I wanted to know so I could brace for it, not that I was scared. The internet just did not talk about that part of the experience. It was littered with five-star reviews that were surprisingly genuine. But none of them mention anything about installation. \u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t, uh, installed it yet. But I haven\u0026rsquo;t said the best part yet. I got two! I got my mom to lie about thinking of getting one. And the store clerk gave us two. He said she\u0026rsquo;d have to return it if she changed her mind. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, because I have TWO. Now we can do it together. Maybe have some sort of duo dive somehow.\u0026rdquo;\nIt takes a minute for my brain to process that bomb he just dropped. he continued to spitball ways to make diving a two-part activity. \u0026ldquo;One for me?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Yeah\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re stupid. Your mom will get into trouble.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Nah, and what can they do about it anyways? You can\u0026rsquo;t uninstall one of these things. It\u0026rsquo;s for life, so what can they do about it? If anything, it is the store clerk\u0026rsquo;s fault.\u0026rdquo; Lance was not always on top of consequences. There would be at least some fine. Dad would be pissed. There would be lawyers involved or something. But maybe it would be okay. How would anyone even know I had one? \u0026ldquo;Can we check out the bridge before deciding to use em? It could be lame or something.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Jason will be there. Do you think inviting us was a joke? Maybe. Alright, we can wait. But I am gonna do some wicked cool stunts off that bridge, just you wait.\u0026rdquo; Lance was a little more deflated as we pedaled to the bridge.\nI hated bursting his bubble like that. But it seems too good. Jason hadn\u0026rsquo;t said more than a few sentences to me for the past few years. And he invited Lance too. It was like he really wanted me to be there. And be there with the cool kids. It seemed like he thought I would belong with them. And now, Lance got us the little slivers. We could look cool and awesome diving off the bridge. It was all too good. There had to be a problem somewhere, my mind told me. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t latched on to the idea that inviting us was a joke, but it made a sort of sense. That could explain the change in attitude. Maybe it would all work out, but my intuition kept sending warning signs.\nAgain sound proceeded light; the thumping of portable speakers was unceasing, cheers of irrepressible delight came intermittently, and softly under the rest were the groans of the rusted trusses wishing the unremitting occupants would leave.\nThere were no streetlights down the dirt road to the bridge. It leads to an old lumber camp. I could roughly tell where Lance was by the gravel, screaming and giving way to his tires. On the bridge, someone must have climbed up the beams and tied a few flashlights to point down at the center of the bridge, leaving it as a beacon of price-efficient sickly light.\nThe indecision was apparent on Lance\u0026rsquo;s face, on whether he should rush to enjoy the fun or leave before the dream crumbled. He settled on coasting up, letting me take the lead.\nI wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure how to approach either. I could hear the large crowd. There must have been at least 60 people on the bridge. But no one was in the center where the light was. They must all be on the edges lurking out of sight, waiting for prey. It might not have been perfect, but we could have used some of Lance\u0026rsquo;s unearned confidence. I compromised by locking my bike to the corner of the bridge, taking my time to do it properly so it would not get stolen.\nI saw shadows moving in between me and the light. It must have been other classmates who were not interested in talking to us. But after a few minutes, an indistinguishable figure approached us, silhouetted by the harsh light. The big frame and confident gait left me wondering if we had come to the wrong spot. Maybe this was a biker gang hideout, and we were about to get it for trespassing.\n\u0026ldquo;E!\u0026rdquo; Jason\u0026rsquo;s voice came from the looming specter. The lights framed his grand gestures. Squinting with my hands over my eyes, it kinda looked like Jason. \u0026ldquo;Jason?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yep! Can\u0026rsquo;t you see me? Maybe not. Sorry, I keep forgetting you don\u0026rsquo;t have a sliver. If you had one, you would be able to see just fine. Almost anywhere, any time. You should really think about getting one. But your eyes will adjust. And I see you brought Lance! Great. Come on in. I\u0026rsquo;ll introduce you all before Nigel jumps. He always gets the biggest splashes.\u0026rdquo;\nJason gestured, and a few boys joined us in the light. Five new boys circled the biggest and roundest, cajoling him into action. Nigel was big but not tall. He was probably one of the heaviest kids in our grade; he was constantly glowering at school. Nigel was another of the kids in our grade that did not have many friends. But now he was here, laughing and having fun. It was clear they were laughing with him, not at him. What happened?\n\u0026ldquo;Hey guys, you know E, and Lance, right?\u0026rdquo; Polite nods all around.\nNigel\u0026rsquo;s grin grew disproportionately big on his face. \u0026ldquo;First time, boys? You are gonna love it. Just pay attention to how I jump. And do something a little safe.\u0026rdquo;\nI was going to say something, like maybe hi. But during Nigel’s last sentence, his center of weight shifted. And was leaning over the bridge. His movement accelerated as he began falling over. His feet were about to hit rusted metal support beams. Instead, his legs pulled in, then sprang back out, pushing off. The bridge whumped from the impact as he shot into the darkness. The others kept looking into the abyss and cheered as a splash sounded. Looking at Lance, he was blind to Nigel, just as I was. It looked like he had fallen into the endless expanse of space. Willingly offering himself to the vultures that surely circle overhead.\n\u0026ldquo;Nigel went all out. That will be tough to beat. So don\u0026rsquo;t worry, just have fun your first time.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry guys, they don\u0026rsquo;t have slivers, yet. They just came to check all the excitement. So let\u0026rsquo;s show them why it\u0026rsquo;s so fun.\u0026rdquo;\nLance raised his hand like he was in class. \u0026ldquo;But I do. I bought some. One for me and one for E. There in my pocket. Right now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh nice, get \u0026rsquo;em\u0026rsquo; up there. And you can go next. No time like the present.\u0026rdquo;\nEdgar took out two pristine plastic cases the size of a ring box. Flipping the lid showed a small pill-like object, one-half purple and the other white. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t shaped like a pill but was the size of one. Instead, it was shaped like an egg. It felt like he was proposing to marry me. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t on his knee, but this felt so permanent, so dangerous. This was a stupid idea. These guys were stupid; they were literally jumping off a bridge. And Lance was running after the bandwagon while I chased him. It was stupid, and I was stupid. But if I didn\u0026rsquo;t follow Lance, who would I have left at school? No one. No one at all. When the choice was to get left behind or do something a little stupid, I only had one choice.\nWe each took one in hand, and the guys started to hoot and holler. Lance counted us down, 3, 2, 1. I hesitated as he shoved it up his nose. Not wanting to appear hesitant, I braced and went to force it up my nose. But Jason was restraining my arm before I could make the last few inches to my nose. Lance fainted.\nJason stared at me blankly, all the joy cached from his face for later use. \u0026ldquo;Edgar Almos Renda\u0026rdquo; His voice was the loudest, less than a foot from my ear. But it sounds more like the school announcement system. Voices from all directions were in sync. Every hidden predatory was announcing their displeasure and wrath in emotionless legal speak. \u0026ldquo;Our records show we do not have parental consent for you, Edgar Almos Renda. As a minor of the human race, you are not allowed to imbibe a sliver, without parental consent. Return the stolen sliver immediately.\u0026rdquo;\nThere was no or else \u0026lsquo;We will kill you like the insignificant creature you are\u0026rsquo;. No threat, simple absolute assurity I would acquiesce. I took a step back, dropping the poisonous bobble I held. Jason let go of my arm, catching the inauspicious egg. \u0026ldquo;Wow, you almost dropped it, E. I mean, you could always get another for free. But then you\u0026rsquo;d miss out on tonight\u0026rsquo;s event.\u0026rdquo; Lance was back on his feet. \u0026ldquo;Come on E. I went through a lot of trouble to get that for you. And it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even feel weird.\u0026rdquo;\nWhy were they ignoring what just happened? Was Lance somehow in on this ahead of time? Jason tried to put the small pill of doom in my hand, but I recoiled. I stepped away, looking back into the darkness for where I had left my bike. These people were dangerous. Images from horror movies flashed through my head. \u0026ldquo;I am gonna go.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What, we just got here, and you haven\u0026rsquo;t even seen me jump.\u0026rdquo;\nWhat was going on here? Why had I come? Why had I thought this was reasonable? I am so stupid. This was too dangerous, and they were out to get me. I gotta get out of here and get to my Dad or the cops. I turned around, sprinting into the darkness. Where was my bike?\nI fumbled along the handrail until I bumped into the worn rubber. Their laughter at me deafened the scratching of my key on the lock. I had come to hang out with Jason. I had come because of Lance. Lance who was laughing and having fun in the light. Lance who would be with the cool kids from now on without me. Not everyone was on the bridge, but my friend was. My last friend. Why was I running from this? Because they said some weird words in unison. I am being stupid. If I ran, who could I hang out with in school? Everyone important in school was supposed to be on the bridge. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t survive as a loner until graduation. And it looked like so much fun in the lights.\nMy keys happily jiggled as they went back into the darkness of my pocket. Sounding their falsely merry chime as I strode back onto the rickety planks to be with the cool welcoming predators.\n","permalink":"https://raworlando.github.io/forgetmeblue/stories/no_such_thing_as_a_free_sliver/","summary":"On Wednesday, the dominos started to fall, which would change my high school social class until graduation.

And I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my mental health. I will break down why this has happened so that you could find something like being a crossing guard that would not appear beneficial but is. Or maybe this will convince you to help kids get to school safely as a crossing guard.\nBeing Outside Previously it was uncommon for me to be outside or leave the house in general. On days with nice weather, I would spend time on my porch, but nothing consistent. Being a crossing guard means I am outside for two hours every weekday: rain or shine, hot or cold. This might sound bad, being out in the rain for a few hours, but there are still benefits even when the weather is terrible.\nBeing in the rain When most people talk about rain as a negative, the few I hear talking about its positives are only talking about the sound it makes as they sit inside by a window with a warm drink. Well, there are more benefits than just the calming sound. It also improves the air quality. You can smell it. Have you stopped to smell any rain lately? The next time it rains, take a step outside and breath deeply. This smell is so powerful it even has a name, petrichor.\nThe air is cleanest when it rains. Anyone with natural airborne allergies notices the relief in their lungs shortly after it rains. It is common wisdom knowledge of the health benefits of fresh air. But we forget that the freshest air is when it is raining.\nBeyond the air quality, the rain helps your mind to be present. This idea of being present will come up later in this article. The rain will tap your skin like a child asking for attention if you let your mind wander. Be in the moment as you stand wet on a street corner.\nGreenspaces Regardless of the skies, just spending time outside in a green space reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression. \u0026ldquo;An analysis of ten studies found that spending time in a green environment improved mood and self-esteem. Those struggling with mental illness saw significant increases in their self-esteem and saw a reduction in their depression symptoms.\u0026rdquo; –ageenvy-digital The streets I work on are lined with trees. And even though I am allergic to them, it is calming to see the leaves sway in the wind.\nSunlight The benefit most commonly known about being outside is sunlight. Studies have shown that brains have higher serotonin levels on a sunny day. (Regardless of temperatures) Serotonin, which will come up again, helps regulate anxiety and happiness, one of a few important chemicals to have in balance for your mental health. Another endorphin, most commonly produced through exercise, is involved in sunlight. \u0026ldquo;Studies have suggested that UV light encourages melanocytes, the cell that produces dark skin pigment, to release endorphins.\u0026rdquo; –ageenvy-digital\nSerotonin does more than boost your mood. Serotonin works in tandem with melatonin, a chemical important for restful sleep. If you have spent the day at the beach in the sun, you have felt this effect. You come home tired and ready for a nap. In moderation, such as the two hours a day I get from this job, it can help stabilize your sleeping cycle. -Cite\nSocializing Covid has stripped many small socializations from life. And this had hit me hard, harder than I expected. Through this, I realized the extroverted tendencies I have. But having a regular amount of socializing is helpful for most people\u0026rsquo;s moods, even introverts. I will exclude the many personal anecdotes where a social interaction from being a crossing guard has made my day or even the whole week.\nSmall talk As a crossing guard, you will make small talk with several pedestrians, saying good morning, asking about their days, and seeing them on their way. This used to be a common part of most lives. Seeing people and making quick chit-chat were not seen as beneficial things. But now, with many jobs going fully remote and with people\u0026rsquo;s habits changing after covid induced isolation, this is not a foregone conclusion anymore.\nA series of experiments revealed that train and bus commuters interacted with other passengers and experienced a more pleasant ride. Even when they believe they would prefer solitude.\nResearch has also shown that this chit-chat contains eye contact, smiling, and a few sentences boosts your mood. So even if you see yourself as someone that does not enjoy social interactions, a dollop of it a day can be helpful to your state of mind.\nGratitude While crossing pedestrians, you will receive many thanks. Having previously worked in an office setting, this was new for me. Being thanked bolstered me, and I felt like my presence had a positive impact. Even if it is just polite niceties, hearing it repeatedly though out the day helped my self-esteem and mood. And more so, when children thank you, you can see the genuineness in their faces. I cross kids as young as two years old. Young children mean what they say.\nDogs While standing on your street corner, you will likely see a few dogs throughout your shift. Dogs can be even more friendly than people coming over to say hi and get some pets. Spending time with pets such as cats and dogs has been shown to elevate serotonin and dopamine levels while reducing stress-related hormones. What\u0026rsquo;s more, these effects can be seen after spending only five minutes with an animal. So even though your interaction with the neighborhood dogs will only be a few minutes a day, the effect will still be present.\nMild Exercise It is well known that exercising is good for you. But usually, we lump this into going to the gym and going through a rigorous workout. Some of those benefits can be seen while doing mild exercise. While being a crossing guard, I walk to work and back home (about five minutes) and move to protect the crosswalk totaling in 3000 steps a shift.\nEven mild movement releases endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine. Previously I worked in an office having a sedentary lifestyle. This increase in regular exercise helped improve my brain chemistry.\nAwareness and being in the moment Often when I read about mental health, there is talk about being present and in the moment. I think the primary purpose of these phrases is not to get lost in your thoughts and listen to your lie tapes. While being a crossing guard, you will exercise this type of awareness. In a typical intersection, there will be four ways a car can approach, eight ways a pedestrian can come, and three different paths they can take once they reach the intersection. As you pay attention to these many paths and options, you can stay in the present through your shift. Although this sounds stressful, with any muscle, you will soon be able to accomplish this without much effort or thought.\nIn conclusion, your body produces chemicals to help your brain function in many different ways. Being a crossing guard will help give you a little of a lot of these. This daily experience has helped stabilize my moods, and I hope it will be helpful on your journey with mental health.\n","permalink":"https://raworlando.github.io/forgetmeblue/post/mental-health-benifits-of-crossing-guarding/","summary":"I have been a crossing guard for a few months now.

He was prepared; he had been five years ago. He had skipped college just to prepare for his ascension to high school reunion king. He would have already accomplished his goal, but the class president, Doug Carman, had been lazy and incompetent. With Facebook, who really needed a reunion anymore? Then Doug Carman had received loads of letters asking why there was no reunion. It must have been an organized effort because they all had similar hawk stamps. So Carman shrugged and put in the minimal effort to have a ten-year reunion for Saltcreek High Class of 2009.\nDoug Shillings confidently glided in wearing the same suit as Doug Shapiro, the prom king, wore in 2009. Doug Shillings had even sculpted his curly hair in the same way. His fohawk needed constant care, leaving Doug Shillings to pat his hair back into place every few minutes.\nA high school girl handling the sign-in table looked up and asked, \u0026ldquo;Doug, right?\u0026rdquo; while giggling. Out of the 87 boys, 11 were not named Doug. And those 11 only had 4 unique names: Jack, Tim, Eric, and Noah. Only Noah had his own personal first name. Us Dougs, all 78 of us were left to use our last names. Lucky for Doug, he had a cool last name. He grabbed his name tag and crossed it out to write \u0026lsquo;The Shill\u0026rsquo;, while shaking his head at the childish joke. Doug Shilling once looked up ‘shill’ but only read the first five words \u0026lsquo;an accomplice of a hawker\u0026rsquo;. He became enthralled with the last word. To Doug Shillings, his name meant hawk or something like that. It was like getting eagle as a nickname.\nAnd that was how he felt as he talked to a group of classmates. Noah \u0026ldquo;Sorry I don\u0026rsquo;t recognize you? Are you a Doug?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s Shill, so what have you been up to, Noah?\u0026rdquo;\nDoug Shillings proceeded not to listen, waiting for Noah to return the question. Noah said something about baking kids into cupcakes. Weird.\nWhen it did finally come back, Shill could not hold it in. \u0026ldquo;Well, I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you for which agency, but I am an international spy.\u0026rdquo; Dougie Shillings pulls out his Diploma in spycraft from spyinamonth.com; it took him half a year of hard work to get and looked far more formal than anything from his home printer. \u0026ldquo;I have been all over switching agencies; Virginia, East Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, and of course the beach. I have been all over the world.\u0026rdquo; To Shill, the group was suitably stunned and impressed. Noah even had his mouth open like a fish. They would all know who to vote for. Tilting down his sunglasses, Doug winks, \u0026ldquo;Hopefully, I won\u0026rsquo;t see any of you out in the field.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Shill left to display his virtues and plumage to another group. It included Doug Shapiro, who was wearing a different suit thankfully. Doug Shillings\u0026rsquo;s most significant hole in his plan was the faux pa of wearing the same outfit as someone else. He had added sunglasses and kept a collapsible fedora in his pocket to make sure it would not occur.\nThey were about to eat some dessert as Doug Shillings swooped in. The Shill without introduction or prelude \u0026ldquo;We must say grace\u0026rdquo; a woman stopped biting into a cupcake. While putting it down \u0026ldquo;O, are you a priest?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, but it is important. Dear teenage Jesus, 15-year-old pimply faced Jesus.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am saying grace.\u0026rdquo;\nApparently, there were uncultured heathens in the Class of 2009. Doug Shilling would show them what they are missing out on. \u0026ldquo;Dear teenage Jesus, just learning curse words, peach fuzz-faced, rebellious Jesus surfing the waves of the ocean on your skateboard-\u0026rdquo;\nDoug Shapiro had a horrified look and ended the prayer early.\n“Thanks for the food, Amen.” He must have realized his crown was in jeopardy. \u0026ldquo;Dude, get out of here.\u0026rdquo; The rest looked suitably stunned, so Shill took a graceful exit with a smile.\nThat would be a good blow to Shapiro’s voter base and Doug needed to make sure the pieces to his finale were ready. He went to the bathroom and started to send out reminder emails. He was planning a flashmob. He had emailed half of the students in his class and the current student body at Saltcreek High. No one had yet to respond to any of his emails. Still, it was such an incredible event there would be at least half participating. How many people could say no to Don\u0026rsquo;t Stop Believing?\nOver the intercom, \u0026ldquo;We have decided to move this party over to the bar. So we will be wrapping up with the reunion king and queen. Which I did not know was a thing, but a lot of you asked for it, so let\u0026rsquo;s get this over with.\u0026rdquo;\nDoug Shillings rushed back in. He would have to be able to win without his finale. It would be close. Regretting coming in fashionably late now, he changed his frantic run to a nonchalant stride into the gymnasium and the public eye. But he had faith that his social media campaign would carry him to victory. He showed off his spycraft diploma to the people around him in line to vote.\nShills perched close to the voting booth and the stage. Peering at the scraps of paper acting as voting ballots he saw ‘Doug’ quite a lot. He would have preferred for them to write down ‘The Shill’. In fact he had added ten baliots written as such. Doug was vibrating in his seat, ten years of preparation was coming together.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, let\u0026rsquo;s do this. Your king of prom, I mean this event is Doug\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n5 different Dougs stood up; Doug Shillings was already walking up the stage.\n\u0026ldquo;No, not you Shills! It is our one and only Noah. The winner is Noah Doug!\u0026rdquo;\nWith the failure of 10 years, Doug Shillings fainted on stage. But there would always be another chance in 10 years. Better start planning, Doug.\n","permalink":"https://raworlando.github.io/forgetmeblue/stories/dougs_big_night/","summary":"Tonight was an important night for Doug Shillings.

I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.\nIn this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the \u0026ldquo;$\u0026rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with \u0026ldquo;#\u0026rdquo; are comments that I\u0026rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the \u0026ldquo;:wq\u0026rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s an example:\n## this is a comment $ echo this is a command this is a command ## edit the file $vi foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug :wq ## show it $ cat foo.md +++ date = \u0026#34;2014-09-28\u0026#34; title = \u0026#34;creating a new theme\u0026#34; +++ bah and humbug $ Some Definitions There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.\nSkins Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.\nYou have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the layouts/ directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the layouts/ directory so it will always find the skin.\nYour second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the themes/ directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?\nThe difference between creating a skin in layouts/ and creating it in themes/ is very subtle. A skin in layouts/ can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in themes/, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.\nThe rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the themes/ directory a theme.\nNote that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the layouts/ directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.\nThe Home Page The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.\nSite Configuration File When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.\nHugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your content/ directory and template files in your themes/ directory. It will create HTML files in your public/ directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.\nContent Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.\nFront Matter The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “+++”, YAML by “---”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.\nThe information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.\nMarkdown Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.\nTemplate Files Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it\u0026rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.\nThere are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.\nHugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.\nPlease note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.\nSingle Template A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.\nList Template A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.\nThe homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.\nPartial Template A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.\nCreate a New Site Let\u0026rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I\u0026rsquo;m a Mac user, so I\u0026rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you\u0026rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.\nThe \u0026ldquo;new site\u0026rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.\n$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta $ cd ~/Sites/zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 16:49 . drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 16:49 .. drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ Take a look in the content/ directory to confirm that it is empty.\nThe other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That\u0026rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.\nGenerate the HTML For the New Site Running the hugo command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that\u0026rsquo;s everything that\u0026rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won\u0026rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.\n$ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms $ The \u0026ldquo;--verbose\u0026rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with \u0026ldquo;INFO:\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with \u0026ldquo;WARN:\u0026rdquo; are warning messages. We\u0026rsquo;ll go over them later.\nWe can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.\n$ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static $ See that new public/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that\u0026rsquo;s the place to start. For now, though, let\u0026rsquo;s just confirm that we have what we\u0026rsquo;d expect from a site with no content.\n$ ls -l public total 16 -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 416 Sep 29 17:02 index.xml -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 262 Sep 29 17:02 sitemap.xml $ Hugo created two XML files, which is standard, but there are no HTML files.\nTest the New Site Verify that you can run the built-in web server. It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the \u0026ldquo;server\u0026rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:\n$ hugo server --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 0 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 2 ms Serving pages from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313 Press Ctrl+C to stop Connect to the listed URL (it\u0026rsquo;s on the line that starts with \u0026ldquo;Web Server\u0026rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:\nindex.xml sitemap.xml That\u0026rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn\u0026rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there\u0026rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.\nLet’s go back and look at those warnings again.\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html] That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.\nNow for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.\nI like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it\u0026rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn\u0026rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.\nAt this point, you\u0026rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.\nCreate a New Theme Hugo doesn\u0026rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.\nWe\u0026rsquo;re going to create a new theme called \u0026ldquo;zafta.\u0026rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.\nAll themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; over \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.\nCreate a Skeleton Use the hugo \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.\n$ hugo new theme zafta $ ls -l total 8 drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 archetypes -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 82 Sep 29 16:49 config.toml drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 content drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:02 public drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 16:49 static drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes $ find themes -type f | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 1081 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/LICENSE.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes/default.md -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/list.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 93 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/theme.toml $ The skeleton includes templates (the files ending in .html), license file, a description of your theme (the theme.toml file), and an empty archetype.\nPlease take a minute to fill out the theme.toml and LICENSE.md files.

This is the file public/index.html. Hugo created a css/ directory. Hugo created a js/ directory. Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn\u0026rsquo;t create any pages. That\u0026rsquo;s because it considers a \u0026ldquo;page\u0026rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically. The Home Page Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:\nWARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html] If it can\u0026rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.\nWhen Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.\n$ find . -name index.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 20:21 ./public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 17:31 ./themes/zafta/layouts/index.html $ The Magic of Static Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.\nHugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo\u0026rsquo;s opinion is that you\u0026rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don\u0026rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo\u0026rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.\n$ find themes/zafta -type d | xargs ls -ld drwxr-xr-x 7 quoha staff 238 Sep 29 17:38 themes/zafta drwxr-xr-x 3 quoha staff 102 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/archetypes drwxr-xr-x 5 quoha staff 170 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/partials drwxr-xr-x 4 quoha staff 136 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/css drwxr-xr-x 2 quoha staff 68 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/static/js $ The Theme Development Cycle When you\u0026rsquo;re working on a theme, you will make changes in the theme\u0026rsquo;s directory, rebuild the site, and check your changes in the browser. Hugo makes this very easy:\nPurge the public/ directory. Run the built in web server in watch mode. Open your site in a browser. Update the theme. Glance at your browser window to see changes. Return to step 4. I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.\nCheck the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.\nPurge the public/ Directory When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the public/ directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.\nNote: If you\u0026rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.\nHugo\u0026rsquo;s Watch Option Hugo\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;--watch\u0026rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.\nLive Reload Hugo\u0026rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload. As pages are saved on the server, the browser is told to refresh the page. Usually, this happens faster than you can say, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s totally amazing.\u0026rdquo;\nDevelopment Commands Use the following commands as the basis for your workflow.\n## purge old files. hugo will recreate the public directory. ## $ rm -rf public ## ## run hugo in watch mode ## $ hugo server --watch --verbose Here\u0026rsquo;s sample output showing Hugo detecting a change to the template for the home page. Once generated, the web browser automatically reloaded the page.

That\u0026rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule (in fact, we\u0026rsquo;ll break it a few times in this tutorial), but it is a good generalization.\nMake a Static Home Page Right now, that page is empty because we don\u0026rsquo;t have any content and we don\u0026rsquo;t have any logic in the template.

The homepage doesn\u0026rsquo;t show the new content, either. We have to update the templates to add the posts.\nList and Single Templates In Hugo, we have three major kinds of templates. There\u0026rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have \u0026ldquo;single\u0026rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have \u0026ldquo;list\u0026rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.\nGenerally speaking, list templates are named \u0026ldquo;list.html\u0026rdquo; and single templates are named \u0026ldquo;single.html.\u0026rdquo;\nThere are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.\nAdd Content to the Homepage The home page will contain a list of posts. Let\u0026rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ end }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between \u0026ldquo;{{\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;}}\u0026rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:\nrange .Title end The \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; command is an iterator. We\u0026rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.\nThe \u0026ldquo;.Title\u0026rdquo; command prints the value of the \u0026ldquo;title\u0026rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.\nThe \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds \u0026ldquo;end.\u0026rdquo; Everything between the \u0026ldquo;range\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;end\u0026rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.\nBuild the web site and then verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:23 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:23 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let\u0026rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we\u0026rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you\u0026rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that\u0026rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.\nAnd, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, though, that\u0026rsquo;s all to come.\nAdd Content to the Posts We\u0026rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo; (and if we don\u0026rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also \u0026ldquo;post\u0026rdquo;).\nHugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can\u0026rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we\u0026rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.\nNow that we know the search rule, let\u0026rsquo;s see what we actually have available:\n$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don\u0026rsquo;t know of any other content types, let\u0026rsquo;s start with updating the default.\nRemember, any content that we haven\u0026rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we\u0026rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we\u0026rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we\u0026rsquo;ve made. It\u0026rsquo;s good because we\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It\u0026rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we\u0026rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we\u0026rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.\nPlease see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you\u0026rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That\u0026rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.\nUpdate the Template File $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq $ Build the web site and verify the results.\n$ rm -rf public $ hugo --verbose INFO: 2014/09/29 Using config file: /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/config.toml INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/themes/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 syncing from /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/static/ to /Users/quoha/Sites/zafta/public/ INFO: 2014/09/29 found taxonomies: map[string]string{\u0026#34;tag\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;tags\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;category\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;categories\u0026#34;} WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html theme/404.html] 0 draft content 0 future content 2 pages created 0 tags created 0 categories created in 4 ms $ find public -type f -name \u0026#39;*.html\u0026#39; | xargs ls -l -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 94 Sep 29 22:40 public/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 125 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/first/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 0 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/index.html -rw-r--r-- 1 quoha staff 128 Sep 29 22:40 public/post/second/index.html $ cat public/post/first/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;first\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my first post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ cat public/post/second/index.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;second\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;my second post\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; $ Notice that the posts now have content.

That\u0026rsquo;s because we didn\u0026rsquo;t put the title in the home page\u0026rsquo;s template (layouts/index.html). That\u0026rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let\u0026rsquo;s look at a different option.\nWe can put the common bits into a shared template that\u0026rsquo;s stored in the themes/zafta/layouts/partials/ directory.\nCreate the Header and Footer Partials In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme\u0026rsquo;s presentation.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/head\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; :wq $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; :wq Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:\n{{ template \u0026#34;theme/partials/header.html\u0026#34; . }} versus\n{{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} Both pass in the context.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }} {{ if eq .Type \u0026#34;post\u0026#34;}} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;pages\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ range .Data.Pages }} {{ if or (eq .Type \u0026#34;page\u0026#34;) (eq .Type \u0026#34;about\u0026#34;) }} \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{ .Permalink }}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ end }} {{ end }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results.

The front matter of our posts has a variable named \u0026ldquo;date.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let\u0026rsquo;s pretend that\u0026rsquo;s the value we want to display.\nAdd “Date Published” to the Template We\u0026rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:\n{{ .Date.Format \u0026#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026#34; }} Posts use the default single template, so we\u0026rsquo;ll change that file.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026#34; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }} :wq Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There\u0026rsquo;s a problem, though. The \u0026ldquo;about\u0026rdquo; page also has the date displayed.\nAs usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of \u0026ldquo;code for today,\u0026rdquo; too.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume, though, that we\u0026rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we\u0026rsquo;re going to create a section template.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.\n$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post $ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }} :wq Now we\u0026rsquo;ll update the post\u0026rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo\u0026rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.\n$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html {{ partial \u0026#34;header.html\u0026#34; . }} \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;{{ .Date.Format \u0026#34;Mon, Jan 2, 2006\u0026#34; }}\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; {{ .Content }} {{ partial \u0026#34;footer.html\u0026#34; . }} :wq Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn\u0026rsquo;t.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t Repeat Yourself DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you\u0026rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you\u0026rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it\u0026rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.\n","permalink":"https://raworlando.github.io/forgetmeblue/examples-posts/creating-a-new-theme/","summary":"Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo.

I\u0026rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won\u0026rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.","title":"Creating a New Theme"},{"content":"Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.\nThis document is a brief primer on using go templates. The go docs provide more details.\nIntroduction to Go Templates Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer. One consequence of this simplicity is that go templates parse very quickly.\nA unique characteristic of go templates is they are content aware. Variables and content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More details can be found in the go docs.\nBasic Syntax Go lang templates are html files with the addition of variables and functions.\nGo variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}\nAccessing a predefined variable \u0026ldquo;foo\u0026rdquo;:\n{{ foo }} Parameters are separated using spaces\nCalling the add function with input of 1, 2:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation\nAccessing the Page Parameter \u0026ldquo;bar\u0026rdquo;\n{{ .Params.bar }} Parentheses can be used to group items together\n{{ if or (isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;) }} Caption {{ end }} Variables Each go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of page you are rendering. More details are available on the variables page.\nA variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.\n\u0026lt;title\u0026gt;{{ .Title }}\u0026lt;/title\u0026gt; Variables can also be defined and referenced.\n{{ $address := \u0026quot;123 Main St.\u0026quot;}} {{ $address }} Functions Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The go template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the available functions with their own. Hugo template functions provide some additional functionality we believe are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.\nExample:\n{{ add 1 2 }} Includes When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at the /layout/ directory within Hugo.\nExample:\n{{ template \u0026quot;chrome/header.html\u0026quot; . }} Logic Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.\nIteration Just like in go, the go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use range.\nExample 1: Using Context\n{{ range array }} {{ . }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring value variable name\n{{range $element := array}} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name\n{{range $index, $element := array}} {{ $index }} {{ $element }} {{ end }} Conditionals If, else, with, or, \u0026amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with end.\nGo Templates treat the following values as false:\nfalse 0 any array, slice, map, or string of length zero Example 1: If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ index .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 2: If -\u0026gt; Else\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{else}} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Example 3: And \u0026amp; Or\n{{ if and (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Example 4: With\nAn alternative way of writing \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent.\nThe first example above could be simplified as:\n{{ with .Params.title }}\u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt;{{ end }} Example 5: If -\u0026gt; Else If\n{{ if isset .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;alt\u0026quot; }} {{ else if isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ index .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; }} {{ end }} Pipes One of the most powerful components of go templates is the ability to stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline\u0026rsquo;s output becomes the input of the following pipe.\nBecause of the very simple syntax of go templates, the pipe is essential to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.\nA few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.\nExample 1 :\n{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }} is the same as\n{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }} It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good illustration of how to use the pipes.\nExample 2 :\n{{ index .Params \u0026quot;disqus_url\u0026quot; | html }} Access the page parameter called \u0026ldquo;disqus_url\u0026rdquo; and escape the HTML.\nExample 3 :\n{{ if or (or (isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot;) (isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;)) (isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot;)}} Stuff Here {{ end }} Could be rewritten as\n{{ isset .Params \u0026quot;caption\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;title\u0026quot; | or isset .Params \u0026quot;attr\u0026quot; | if }} Stuff Here {{ end }} Context (aka. the dot) The most easily overlooked concept to understand about go templates is that {{ . }} always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. . will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable instead of depending on the context.\nExample:\n{{ $title := .Site.Title }} {{ range .Params.tags }} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}\u0026quot;\u0026gt;{{ . }}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; - {{ $title }} \u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{ end }} Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within the loop.\nHugo Parameters Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however you want to inside of your templates.\nUsing Content (page) Parameters In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the templates. This happens in the front matter.\nAn example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just doesn\u0026rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We\u0026rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.\nHere is the example front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Permalinks\u0026#34; date: \u0026#34;2013-11-18\u0026#34; aliases: - \u0026#34;/doc/permalinks/\u0026#34; groups: [\u0026#34;extras\u0026#34;] groups_weight: 30 notoc: true --- Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:\n{{ if not .Params.notoc }} \u0026lt;div id=\u0026quot;toc\u0026quot; class=\u0026quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6\u0026quot;\u0026gt; {{ .TableOfContents }} \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} Using Site (config) Parameters In your top-level configuration file (eg, config.yaml) you can define site parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.\nFor instance, you might declare:\nparams: CopyrightHTML: \u0026#34;Copyright \u0026amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.\u0026#34; TwitterUser: \u0026#34;spf13\u0026#34; SidebarRecentLimit: 5 Within a footer layout, you might then declare a \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; which is only provided if the CopyrightHTML parameter is provided, and if it is given, you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped again. This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.\n{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}\u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;text-center\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/footer\u0026gt;{{end}} An alternative way of writing the \u0026ldquo;if\u0026rdquo; and then referencing the same value is to use \u0026ldquo;with\u0026rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context . within its scope, and skips the block if the variable is absent:\n{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}\u0026lt;span class=\u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://twitter.com/{{.}}\u0026#34; rel=\u0026#34;author\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;/images/twitter.png\u0026#34; width=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; height=\u0026#34;48\u0026#34; title=\u0026#34;Twitter: {{.}}\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Twitter\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/span\u0026gt;{{end}} Finally, if you want to pull \u0026ldquo;magic constants\u0026rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do so, such as in this example:\n\u0026lt;nav class=\u0026#34;recent\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt;Recent Posts\u0026lt;/h1\u0026gt; \u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}} \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;{{.RelPermalink}}\u0026#34;\u0026gt;{{.Title}}\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; {{end}}\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/nav\u0026gt; ","permalink":"https://raworlando.github.io/forgetmeblue/examples-posts/goisforlovers/","summary":"Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine.
