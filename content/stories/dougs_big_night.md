Tonight was an important night for Doug Shillings. He was prepared; he had been five years ago. He had skipped college just to prepare for his ascension to high school reunion king. He would have already accomplished his goal, but the class president, Doug Carman, had been lazy and incompetent. With Facebook, who really needed a reunion anymore? Then Doug Carman had received loads of letters asking why there was no reunion. It must have been an organized effort because they all had similar hawk stamps. So Carman shrugged and put in the minimal effort to have a ten-year reunion for Saltcreek High Class of 2009.

Doug Shillings confidently glided in wearing the same suit as Doug Shapiro, the prom king, wore in 2009. Doug Shillings had even sculpted his curly hair in the same way. His fohawk needed constant care, leaving Doug Shillings to pat his hair back into place every few minutes.

A high school girl handling the sign-in table looked up and asked, "Doug, right?" while giggling. Out of the 87 boys, 11 were not named Doug. And those 11 only had 4 unique names: Jack, Tim, Eric, and Noah. Only Noah had his own personal first name. Us Dougs, all 78 of us were left to use our last names. Lucky for Doug, he had a cool last name. He grabbed his name tag and crossed it out to write 'The Shill', while shaking his head at the childish joke. Doug Shilling once looked up ‘shill’ but only read the first five words 'an accomplice of a hawker'. He became enthralled with the last word. To Doug Shillings, his name meant hawk or something like that. It was like getting eagle as a nickname.

And that was how he felt as he talked to a group of classmates. Noah "Sorry I don't recognize you? Are you a Doug?"

"It's Shill, so what have you been up to, Noah?" 

Doug Shillings proceeded not to listen, waiting for Noah to return the question. Noah said something about baking kids into cupcakes. Weird.

When it did finally come back, Shill could not hold it in. "Well, I can't tell you for which agency, but I am an international spy." Dougie Shillings pulls out his Diploma in spycraft from spyinamonth.com; it took him half a year of hard work to get and looked far more formal than anything from his home printer. "I have been all over switching agencies; Virginia, East Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, and of course the beach. I have been all over the world." To Shill, the group was suitably stunned and impressed. Noah even had his mouth open like a fish. They would all know who to vote for. Tilting down his sunglasses, Doug winks, "Hopefully, I won't see any of you out in the field."

The Shill left to display his virtues and plumage to another group. It included Doug Shapiro, who was wearing a different suit thankfully. Doug Shillings's most significant hole in his plan was the faux pa of wearing the same outfit as someone else. He had added sunglasses and kept a collapsible fedora in his pocket to make sure it would not occur.

They were about to eat some dessert as Doug Shillings swooped in. The Shill without introduction or prelude "We must say grace" a woman stopped biting into a cupcake. While putting it down "O, are you a priest?" 

"No, but it is important. Dear teenage Jesus, 15-year-old pimply faced Jesus."

"What?!"

"I am saying grace."  

Apparently, there were uncultured heathens in the Class of 2009. Doug Shilling would show them what they are missing out on. 
"Dear teenage Jesus, just learning curse words, peach fuzz-faced, rebellious Jesus surfing the waves of the ocean on your skateboard-"

Doug Shapiro had a horrified look and ended the prayer early.

“Thanks for the food, Amen.” He must have realized his crown was in jeopardy. "Dude, get out of here." The rest looked suitably stunned, so Shill took a graceful exit with a smile. 

That would be a good blow to Shapiro’s voter base and Doug needed to make sure the pieces to his finale were ready. He went to the bathroom and started to send out reminder emails. He was planning a flashmob. He had emailed half of the students in his class and the current student body at Saltcreek High. No one had yet to respond to any of his emails. Still, it was such an incredible event there would be at least half participating. How many people could say no to Don't Stop Believing?

Over the intercom, "We have decided to move this party over to the bar. So we will be wrapping up with the reunion king and queen. Which I did not know was a thing, but a lot of you asked for it, so let's get this over with."

Doug Shillings rushed back in. He would have to be able to win without his finale. It would be close. Regretting coming in fashionably late now, he changed his frantic run to a nonchalant stride into the gymnasium and the public eye. But he had faith that his social media campaign would carry him to victory. He showed off his spycraft diploma to the people around him in line to vote.

Shills perched close to the voting booth and the stage. Peering at the scraps of paper acting as voting ballots he saw ‘Doug’ quite a lot. He would have preferred for them to write down ‘The Shill’. In fact he had added ten baliots written as such. Doug was vibrating in his seat, ten years of preparation was coming together. 

"Alright, let's do this. Your king of prom, I mean this event is Doug..."

5 different Dougs stood up; Doug Shillings was already walking up the stage.

"No, not you Shills! It is our one and only Noah. The winner is Noah Doug!"

With the failure of 10 years, Doug Shillings fainted on stage. But there would always be another chance in 10 years. Better start planning, Doug.
