On Wednesday, the dominos started to fall, which would change my high school social class until graduation. It started with my old friend Jason Pier.

"E! You're coming to the bridge Friday night, right?"
He sidled over to the middle of the classroom, where only me and Lance Shoo sat by the window. Jason had stopped hanging out with me three years ago when his muscles developed more than mine, and he became a regular on the baseball team. Jason had grown up while I was still a lanky kid, or at least he tried to look it with gelled-back hair and sneakers so pristine they have never even heard the word.

"What's going on at the bridge on Friday?

"What?! Haven't you come before? Well, then you got to come this time. It's the essence of high school." Jason talked with grand, expansive gestures as though he might lose our attention. "We're diving off the bridge. It's so much fun."

"Jason... that sounds dangerous." Lance shot a hurt glance at me for not jumping at the opportunity
"No, well, maybe a little" Jason was unperturbed by the suggestion and giggled as though the danger made it better. "But that's where the slivers come in. You do some amazing stuff as you fall. No one ever gets hurt."

"I don't know, but that won't work. I don't have a sliver." It seemed like more and more people were getting them. We didn't need to attach something to our brains.

"You don't?, Well, you don't have to jump then, E. Come on, we haven't hung out in ages."

Jason's eyebrows did an encouraging dance until Lance blurted, "We'll come, he'll come. I mean." Lance's words toppled over each other, trying to fix his mistake. Jason took in the other boy for the first time, reviewing the name at the top of his assignment.
"Yeah, yeah, Lance is comin. The more, the merrier. You gotta come now. I will send you a thought with the details. wait. no sliver. Come to the old bridge after 9 on Friday night! That's more adventurous anyways. None of these omw, crap. Just show up; nothing to it." Jason was not letting any hurdle stand in between him and his goal. With a grand smile, now that it was all sorted, he walked off without getting an affirmation.

"Edgar! We got to go." I could see why Lance wanted to hang out with the cool kids. We had been missing something since Teddy moved away last month. But Jason was not actually our friend, not for three years.

"I don't know, Lance; we might not really fit in."

"Come onnn! We could look so cool jumping off the bridge! And be popular!" We were kind of losers at school, and Lance jumped at the chance to move up in the world’s hierarchy.

"Lance, we don't have slivers. We could get hurt jumping."

"Let's get some then. This is our chance to look awesome in front of everyone!'

"Not everyone will be there."

"Everyone important."

Lance was relentless; no matter the reason, he found a way around until I caved.

When I got home, I started my preparations: I cloroxed the kitchen surfaces, I vacuumed the living room, I didn't bother or upset Tio, and I even started a fresh load in the washing machine. When Dad came home from his nursing shift, he predictably went to the kitchen where I was chopping vegetables.

When the three of us were all sitting down around the pan of chop suey. Dad looked at me, spent from his shift at the hospital.

"Alright, E, what's with this behavior?"

This plan always works best when he does not realize anything is different, just that he is happier. I needed to go into damage control.
"What!, No , I'm not acting any different." I stared into his intent eyes, so he knew I was not lying.

"What do you want? We don't have any spare money to buy something if that's what you're thinking." Dad said between modest bites of the pasta as though I forgot that.

"I mean, there is something I wanted, but not to buy. It doesn't cost any money."

"Buy something with no cost? E that does not exist. Everything has a price."

"No, Dad, this doesn't. I wanted to get a sliver. The things the aliens are selling. They are free; I just need your consent." I slid papers awaiting his signature keeping it clear of the dangerous food.

Tio chimed in, "Timmy in gym class has one. And he is really good at basketball." [Ruin the form a bit?

Smiling at Tio, I kept up the reasonable patter; I needed it to seem like a normal everyday event.
"Jason has one, too. Most of the kids in my class have one."

"I heard about these on the news. And you're okay with that what's it crawling up your nose?" Dad had a slight shiver just talking about it.

"Sliver, Dad. And sure, why not." I kept my face calm as thou that idea did not creep me out.

Putting down his spoon, signaling the end of the conversation.
"You want this?"
"Yeah"
"Alright then. I'm gonna look into it; then we can talk about it some."
"But, I need one by Friday. Also, can I go out Friday night?"

The skeptical look came back over his face. "I am working late tomorrow. I need time to look into this before I let one crawl up your nose. But” the last word hung in the air, “ you can go out, be home by ten."

Friday came as a cloudy night. The stars failed to show, leaving splotches of darkness surrounding the halos of light cast by the street lamps. I beat Lance to our usual meeting spot in front of the small playground. It was where all our friends in elementary school would meet. Lance and I were all that remained. I heard his screeching brakes before he left the darkness. The first thing I noticed was his fanatical grin; the second was that he had forgotten his helmet. His mouth opened wider as he spewed word vomit in between desperate wheezes.
"Edgar, you're already here!, I have great news., I got 'em!."
"What really you got one!"
"Yes! Gonna be so cool! You know I am. Off the bridge" He nearly careened into my bike before stopping and catching his breath.
"What did it feel like, you know, crawling up there?" I wanted to know so I could brace for it, not that I was scared. The internet just did not talk about that part of the experience. It was littered with five-star reviews that were surprisingly genuine. But none of them mention anything about installation.
"I haven't, uh, installed it yet. But I haven't said the best part yet. I got two! I got my mom to lie about thinking of getting one. And the store clerk gave us two. He said she'd have to return it if she changed her mind. Doesn't matter, because I have TWO. Now we can do it together. Maybe have some sort of duo dive somehow."

It takes a minute for my brain to process that bomb he just dropped. he continued to spitball ways to make diving a two-part activity.
"One for me?"
"Yeah"
"You're stupid. Your mom will get into trouble."
"Nah, and what can they do about it anyways? You can't uninstall one of these things. It's for life, so what can they do about it? If anything, it is the store clerk's fault."
Lance was not always on top of consequences. There would be at least some fine. Dad would be pissed. There would be lawyers involved or something. But maybe it would be okay. How would anyone even know I had one?
"Can we check out the bridge before deciding to use em? It could be lame or something."
"Jason will be there. Do you think inviting us was a joke? Maybe. Alright, we can wait. But I am gonna do some wicked cool stunts off that bridge, just you wait."
Lance was a little more deflated as we pedaled to the bridge.

I hated bursting his bubble like that. But it seems too good. Jason hadn't said more than a few sentences to me for the past few years. And he invited Lance too. It was like he really wanted me to be there. And be there with the cool kids. It seemed like he thought I would belong with them. And now, Lance got us the little slivers. We could look cool and awesome diving off the bridge. It was all too good. There had to be a problem somewhere, my mind told me. I hadn't latched on to the idea that inviting us was a joke, but it made a sort of sense. That could explain the change in attitude. Maybe it would all work out, but my intuition kept sending warning signs.

Again sound proceeded light; the thumping of portable speakers was unceasing, cheers of irrepressible delight came intermittently, and softly under the rest were the groans of the rusted trusses wishing the unremitting occupants would leave.

There were no streetlights down the dirt road to the bridge. It leads to an old lumber camp. I could roughly tell where Lance was by the gravel, screaming and giving way to his tires. On the bridge, someone must have climbed up the beams and tied a few flashlights to point down at the center of the bridge, leaving it as a beacon of price-efficient sickly light.

The indecision was apparent on Lance's face, on whether he should rush to enjoy the fun or leave before the dream crumbled. He settled on coasting up, letting me take the lead.

I wasn't sure how to approach either. I could hear the large crowd. There must have been at least 60 people on the bridge. But no one was in the center where the light was. They must all be on the edges lurking out of sight, waiting for prey. It might not have been perfect, but we could have used some of Lance's unearned confidence. I compromised by locking my bike to the corner of the bridge, taking my time to do it properly so it would not get stolen.

I saw shadows moving in between me and the light. It must have been other classmates who were not interested in talking to us. But after a few minutes, an indistinguishable figure approached us, silhouetted by the harsh light. The big frame and confident gait left me wondering if we had come to the wrong spot. Maybe this was a biker gang hideout, and we were about to get it for trespassing.

"E!" Jason's voice came from the looming specter. The lights framed his grand gestures. Squinting with my hands over my eyes, it kinda looked like Jason. "Jason?"

"Yep! Can't you see me? Maybe not. Sorry, I keep forgetting you don't have a sliver. If you had one, you would be able to see just fine. Almost anywhere, any time. You should really think about getting one. But your eyes will adjust. And I see you brought Lance! Great. Come on in. I'll introduce you all before Nigel jumps. He always gets the biggest splashes."

Jason gestured, and a few boys joined us in the light. Five new boys circled the biggest and roundest, cajoling him into action. Nigel was big but not tall. He was probably one of the heaviest kids in our grade; he was constantly glowering at school. Nigel was another of the kids in our grade that did not have many friends. But now he was here, laughing and having fun. It was clear they were laughing with him, not at him. What happened?

"Hey guys, you know E, and Lance, right?" Polite nods all around.

Nigel's grin grew disproportionately big on his face. "First time, boys? You are gonna love it. Just pay attention to how I jump. And do something a little safe."

I was going to say something, like maybe hi. But during Nigel’s last sentence, his center of weight shifted. And was leaning over the bridge. His movement accelerated as he began falling over. His feet were about to hit rusted metal support beams. Instead, his legs pulled in, then sprang back out, pushing off. The bridge whumped from the impact as he shot into the darkness. The others kept looking into the abyss and cheered as a splash sounded. Looking at Lance, he was blind to Nigel, just as I was. It looked like he had fallen into the endless expanse of space. Willingly offering himself to the vultures that surely circle overhead.

"Nigel went all out. That will be tough to beat. So don't worry, just have fun your first time."

"Sorry guys, they don't have slivers, yet. They just came to check all the excitement. So let's show them why it's so fun."

Lance raised his hand like he was in class. "But I do. I bought some. One for me and one for E. There in my pocket. Right now."

"Oh nice, get 'em' up there. And you can go next. No time like the present."

Edgar took out two pristine plastic cases the size of a ring box. Flipping the lid showed a small pill-like object, one-half purple and the other white. It wasn't shaped like a pill but was the size of one. Instead, it was shaped like an egg. It felt like he was proposing to marry me. He wasn't on his knee, but this felt so permanent, so dangerous. This was a stupid idea. These guys were stupid; they were literally jumping off a bridge. And Lance was running after the bandwagon while I chased him. It was stupid, and I was stupid. But if I didn't follow Lance, who would I have left at school? No one. No one at all. When the choice was to get left behind or do something a little stupid, I only had one choice.

We each took one in hand, and the guys started to hoot and holler. Lance counted us down,
3,
    2,
        1.
I hesitated as he shoved it up his nose. Not wanting to appear hesitant, I braced and went to force it up my nose. But Jason was restraining my arm before I could make the last few inches to my nose. Lance fainted.

Jason stared at me blankly, all the joy cached from his face for later use. "Edgar Almos Renda" His voice was the loudest, less than a foot from my ear. But it sounds more like the school announcement system. Voices from all directions were in sync. Every hidden predatory was announcing their displeasure and wrath in emotionless legal speak.
"Our records show we do not have parental consent for you, Edgar Almos Renda. As a minor of the human race, you are not allowed to imbibe a sliver, without parental consent. Return the stolen sliver immediately."

There was no or else 'We will kill you like the insignificant creature you are'. No threat, simple absolute assurity I would acquiesce. I took a step back, dropping the poisonous bobble I held. Jason let go of my arm, catching the inauspicious egg. "Wow, you almost dropped it, E. I mean, you could always get another for free. But then you'd miss out on tonight's event."
Lance was back on his feet. "Come on E. I went through a lot of trouble to get that for you. And it doesn't even feel weird."

Why were they ignoring what just happened? Was Lance somehow in on this ahead of time? Jason tried to put the small pill of doom in my hand, but I recoiled. I stepped away, looking back into the darkness for where I had left my bike. These people were dangerous. Images from horror movies flashed through my head. "I am gonna go." "What, we just got here, and you haven't even seen me jump."

What was going on here? Why had I come? Why had I thought this was reasonable? I am so stupid. This was too dangerous, and they were out to get me. I gotta get out of here and get to my Dad or the cops. I turned around, sprinting into the darkness. Where was my bike?

I fumbled along the handrail until I bumped into the worn rubber. Their laughter at me deafened the scratching of my key on the lock. I had come to hang out with Jason. I had come because of Lance. Lance who was laughing and having fun in the light. Lance who would be with the cool kids from now on without me. Not everyone was on the bridge, but my friend was. My last friend. Why was I running from this? Because they said some weird words in unison. I am being stupid. If I ran, who could I hang out with in school? Everyone important in school was supposed to be on the bridge. I couldn't survive as a loner until graduation. And it looked like so much fun in the lights.

My keys happily jiggled as they went back into the darkness of my pocket. Sounding their falsely merry chime as I strode back onto the rickety planks to be with the cool welcoming predators.
