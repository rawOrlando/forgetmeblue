Let's first talk about this newer genre, which is Litrpg. To be a good Litrpg, you are combining two things. The engagement of a story with the dopamine of progress. This progress is usually in the form of numbers, like levels in a video game. This might sound juvenile, but I admit it is a guilty pleasure. They have hooked me like cookie clickers. My brain wants to make the numbers go up. Hearing this disruption, you might think this is a video game rpg but without the videos.
Well, it is, but it isn't in a video game; your choices are limited by the confines of the game, except in cut scenes, the protagonist can't pull out a novel’s exciting solution to a problem. This allows the outcome and actions to remain in question. Litrpgs have two other main advantages. In many video games, especially RPGs, where your character levels up when you fail, you can try again. This causes limited stakes in the outcome of any action, which limits tension. The second is less grinding. In rpg games, often players will go do something unexciting or interesting to get stronger. If this ever happens in a Litrpg, which, in my opinion, it should be avoided, they can gloss over it without spending the audience's time.

Now, let's talk Shadeslinger.

The main character Ned is weak. We start by seeing him before he enters the video game world. He has no friends. From the main character's opinion, everyone around him only want him for his money. He inherited a ungodly amount of wealth. He uses this money to buy all the extremely expensive early access slots in the ripple system video game. To only use one and stop others from getting them. He is selfish to extremes here. When interacting with others in the game, he does not give them a chance to be friends and relegates them to a monetary contract. He frames this as protecting himself, but it is clear he causes the poor relationship problems himself. But do not worry because he is immersing himself in a whole new world that is living and breathing, where he can make friends with NPCs and the two AI he hangs out with. In this new world, he amasses power and money, creating the same problem in relationship dynamics while also not treating the npcs or ai like real people. He has flashes where he does, and he is better about it than the owner of the game, but he is quite shitty about it himself. He does nto see them as people and does not mind letting them suffer. So I don’t think his relationship issues are because he has been dealt a bad hand but instead is on himself.

Next, let’s talk about the ripple system. One of the unique ideas behind the game is that when you affect the game world, it causes a ripple. And you, as a character, are rewarded. The first time Ned does this it is without knowing, as he saves the nicer of the two elf races dooming the other to near extinction. This created a problem. His motivations were now corrupted. It was a cool mechanic to reward a hero of a story, as they immerse themselves in the game world as the reader does the story. But Ned know thinks about ripples as a risk-reward equation in his head when making decisions in the future, which takes away the heroism in saving a town, when Ned wants the reward. This might have been fixable if ned did not think these thoughts to the audience.

It was a fun litrpg, but these two glaring issues were hard for me to ignore, so I will not be reading the sequel.
