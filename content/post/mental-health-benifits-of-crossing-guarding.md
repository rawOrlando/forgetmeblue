I have been a crossing guard for a few months now. And I have noticed a remarkable improvement in my mental health. I will break down why this has happened so that you could find something like being a crossing guard that would not appear beneficial but is. Or maybe this will convince you to help kids get to school safely as a crossing guard.



## Being Outside



Previously it was uncommon for me to be outside or leave the house in general. On days with nice weather, I would spend time on my porch, but nothing consistent. Being a crossing guard means I am outside for two hours every weekday: rain or shine, hot or cold. This might sound bad, being out in the rain for a few hours, but there are still benefits even when the weather is terrible.



### Being in the rain

When most people talk about rain as a negative, the few I hear talking about its positives are only talking about the sound it makes as they sit inside by a window with a warm drink. Well, there are more benefits than just the calming sound. It also improves the air quality. You can smell it. Have you stopped to smell any rain lately? The next time it rains, take a step outside and breath deeply. This smell is so powerful it even has a name, petrichor.

The air is cleanest when it rains. Anyone with natural airborne allergies notices the relief in their lungs shortly after it rains. It is common wisdom knowledge of the health benefits of fresh air. But we forget that the freshest air is when it is raining.

Beyond the air quality, the rain helps your mind to be present. This idea of being present will come up later in this article. The rain will tap your skin like a child asking for attention if you let your mind wander. Be in the moment as you stand wet on a street corner.


### Greenspaces

Regardless of the skies, just spending time outside in a green space reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression. "An [analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3393816/) of ten studies found that spending time in a green environment improved mood and self-esteem. Those struggling with mental illness saw significant increases in their self-esteem and saw a reduction in their depression symptoms." –[ageenvy-digital](https://lifeworkscc.com/mental-health-benefits-outdoors/) The streets I work on are lined with trees. And even though I am allergic to them, it is calming to see the leaves sway in the wind.



### Sunlight

The benefit most commonly known about being outside is sunlight. [Studies](https://time.com/4888327/why-sunlight-is-so-good-for-you/) have shown that brains have higher serotonin levels on a sunny day. (Regardless of temperatures) Serotonin, which will come up again, helps regulate anxiety and happiness, one of a few important chemicals to have in balance for your mental health. Another endorphin, most commonly produced through exercise, is involved in sunlight. "Studies have suggested that UV light encourages melanocytes, the cell that produces dark skin pigment, to release endorphins."  –[ageenvy-digital](https://lifeworkscc.com/mental-health-benefits-outdoors/)


Serotonin does more than boost your mood. Serotonin works in tandem with melatonin, a chemical important for restful sleep. If you have spent the day at the beach in the sun, you have felt this effect. You come home tired and ready for a nap. In moderation, such as the two hours a day I get from this job, it can help stabilize your sleeping cycle.

## Socializing

Covid has stripped many small socializations from life. And this had hit me hard, harder than I expected. Through this, I realized the extroverted tendencies I have. But having a regular amount of socializing is helpful for most people's moods, even introverts. I will exclude the many personal anecdotes where a social interaction from being a crossing guard has made my day or even the whole week.



### Small talk

As a crossing guard, you will make small talk with several pedestrians, saying good morning, asking about their days, and seeing them on their way. This used to be a common part of most lives. Seeing people and making quick chit-chat were not seen as beneficial things. But now, with many jobs going fully remote and with people's habits changing after covid induced isolation, this is not a foregone conclusion anymore.



 A [series of experiments](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Fa0037323) revealed that train and bus commuters interacted with other passengers and experienced a more pleasant ride. Even when they believe they would prefer solitude.



[Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550613502990) has also shown that this chit-chat contains eye contact, smiling, and a few sentences boosts your mood. So even if you see yourself as someone that does not enjoy social interactions, a dollop of it a day can be helpful to your state of mind.



### Gratitude

While crossing pedestrians, you will receive many thanks. Having previously worked in an office setting, this was new for me. Being thanked bolstered me, and I felt like my presence had a positive impact. Even if it is just polite niceties, hearing it repeatedly though out the day helped my self-esteem and mood. And more so, when children thank you, you can see the genuineness in their faces. I cross kids as young as two years old. Young children mean what they say.



### Dogs

While standing on your street corner, you will likely see a few dogs throughout your shift. Dogs can be even more friendly than people coming over to say hi and get some pets. Spending time with pets such as cats and dogs has been shown to elevate serotonin and dopamine levels while reducing stress-related hormones. What's more, these effects can be seen after spending only five minutes with an animal. So even though your interaction with the neighborhood dogs will only be a few minutes a day, the effect will still be present.



## Mild Exercise

It is well known that exercising is good for you. But usually, we lump this into going to the gym and going through a rigorous workout. Some of those benefits can be seen while doing mild exercise. While being a crossing guard, I walk to work and back home (about five minutes) and move to protect the crosswalk totaling in 3000 steps a shift.



Even mild movement releases endorphins, serotonin, and dopamine. Previously I worked in an office having a sedentary lifestyle. This increase in regular exercise helped improve my brain chemistry.




## Awareness and being in the moment

Often when I read about mental health, there is talk about being present and in the moment. I think the primary purpose of these phrases is not to get lost in your thoughts and listen to your lie tapes. While being a crossing guard, you will exercise this type of awareness. In a typical intersection, there will be four ways a car can approach, eight ways a pedestrian can come, and three different paths they can take once they reach the intersection. As you pay attention to these many paths and options, you can stay in the present through your shift. Although this sounds stressful, with any muscle, you will soon be able to accomplish this without much effort or thought.




In conclusion, your body produces chemicals to help your brain function in many different ways. Being a crossing guard will help give you a little of a lot of these. This daily experience has helped stabilize my moods, and I hope it will be helpful on your journey with mental health.
